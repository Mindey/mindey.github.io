_"We want to be able to share, yet not to disturb each others' work. We want to access, yet not to destroy each others' work. We want to let each others' knowledge last for long time, yet we want to let only the trusted and loved ones to see our private thoughts. We want each work to have its unique location, so that we can reference it. We want a point of access to all our information in all social networks, and translatable to, and computable with all languages. I'd like to use wiki, as a communication paradigm."_

## Everything is...

_<u>Substance</u> **X** = <u>Essence</u>_, where:<br>
- _<u>Substance</u> = [[Agents](https://wefindx.net/Agent.html), [Things](https://wefindx.net/Asset.html), [Places](https://wefindx.net/Place.html), [Events](https://wefindx.net/Event.html), [Topics](https://wefindx.net/Topic.html),..]_<br>
- _**X** = [[Actions](https://wefindx.net/Action.html),..]_<br>
- _<u>Essence</u> = [[Needs](https://wefindx.net/Need.html), [Goals](https://wefindx.net/Goal.html), [Ideas](https://wefindx.net/Idea.html), [Plans](https://wefindx.net/Plan.html), [Steps](https://wefindx.net/Plan.html), Tasks, Works,..]_<br>

It's _<u>F</u> **X** = <u>Y</u>_, which we solve for _**"X"**_ by using **math**, when we know _<u>F</u>_ and _<u>Y</u>_ by using **stats**.

## A game that "can give +10 years of life":

- **Mental**: tackle simple tasks often,
- **Physical**: don't sit still for >1 hour,
- **Emotional**: think of 3 good emotions to every bad 1
- **Social**: do reach out to >=1 person you care every single day of your life.
